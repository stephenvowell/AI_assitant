Workspace: The provided HTML document is a web page designed to function as an IoT (Internet of Things) gateway interface. It includes various elements such as navigation links, a weather widget, gauges for monitoring temperatures, and control buttons for different devices.

The document begins with the standard HTML structure, including the `<head>` section where meta tags, the page title, and links to external stylesheets and JavaScript libraries are defined. The JavaScript libraries included are for MQTT (a lightweight messaging protocol), Raphael (a JavaScript library for vector graphics), and JustGage (a library for creating gauge charts).

In the `<body>` section, a navigation bar is created with links to different pages. Below the navigation bar, a weather widget is included, which displays the current weather in Sparta, TN. This widget initially shows "Loading..." and "-- °F" until the actual data is fetched.

Following the weather widget, there is a placeholder `<div>` and a section containing three gauge charts. These gauges are used to display temperatures from different sources: Stephen's PC, a Raspberry Pi 5, and the current outside temperature. Each gauge is initialized with specific properties such as minimum and maximum values, colors, and labels.

Below the gauges, there are control buttons for various devices like living room lights, the front door, and a fireplace. These buttons are placeholders and do not have any functionality defined in the provided code.

The script section at the end of the document contains JavaScript code that runs when the page is fully loaded. This code includes functions to connect to an MQTT broker, set up the MQTT client, initialize the gauges, update the gauges with new temperature values, and fetch the current temperature from a weather API.

The [`connectToBroker`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FD%3A%2FAI_assitant%2FmqttStuff%2Fbutton.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A58%2C%22character%22%3A21%7D%7D%5D%2C%221835b3c1-cdd7-4502-b349-ffb54f58fdd8%22%5D "Go to definition") function establishes a connection to an MQTT broker at `ws://192.168.1.19:9001`. Upon successful connection, it calls the [`setupClient`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FD%3A%2FAI_assitant%2FmqttStuff%2Fbutton.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A63%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%5D%2C%221835b3c1-cdd7-4502-b349-ffb54f58fdd8%22%5D "Go to definition") function, which subscribes to specific topics (`pc/temperature` and `pi5/temperature`) and handles incoming messages by updating the corresponding gauges.

The [`updateGauge`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FD%3A%2FAI_assitant%2FmqttStuff%2Fbutton.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A93%2C%22character%22%3A24%7D%7D%5D%2C%221835b3c1-cdd7-4502-b349-ffb54f58fdd8%22%5D "Go to definition") function processes the received temperature data, parses it, and updates the gauge with the new value. The [`fetchCurrentTemperature`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FD%3A%2FAI_assitant%2FmqttStuff%2Fbutton.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A177%2C%22character%22%3A21%7D%7D%5D%2C%221835b3c1-cdd7-4502-b349-ffb54f58fdd8%22%5D "Go to definition") function retrieves the current temperature from the OpenWeatherMap API and updates the third gauge and the weather widget with the fetched data. This function is called every five minutes to keep the displayed temperature up to date.

Overall, this HTML document serves as a dynamic interface for monitoring and controlling various IoT devices, leveraging MQTT for real-time data updates and an external API for weather information.

stephenvowell: the gauges connected to Stephen's pc and raspberry pi 5 are not updating

Workspace: To troubleshoot why the gauges connected to Stephen's PC and Raspberry Pi 5 are not updating, follow these steps:

1. **Check MQTT Broker Connection**:
   Ensure that the MQTT broker at `ws://192.168.1.19:9001` is running and accessible. Verify that there are no connection errors in the browser console.

2. **Verify MQTT Topics**:
   Confirm that the topics `pc/temperature` and `pi5/temperature` are being published with the correct data. You can use an MQTT client tool like MQTT Explorer to inspect the messages being published to these topics.

3. **Check JavaScript Console for Errors**:
   Open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`) and check the console for any errors or warnings that might indicate issues with the MQTT connection or message handling.

4. **Ensure Correct Topic Subscription**:
   Verify that the [`setupClient`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FD%3A%2FAI_assitant%2FmqttStuff%2Fbutton.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A63%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%5D%2C%224c573a34-cadd-4a9c-a8e6-37412bb21c1c%22%5D "Go to definition") function is correctly subscribing to the topics and handling incoming messages. The relevant code is:

   ```javascript
   function setupClient(client) {
       const topic1 = 'pc/temperature';
       const topic2 = 'pi5/temperature';

       client.subscribe([topic1, topic2], (err) => {
           if (!err) {
               console.log(`Subscribed to topics: ${topic1}, ${topic2}`);
           } else {
               console.error(`Failed to subscribe to topics: ${topic1}, ${topic2}`, err);
           }
       });

       client.on('message', (topic, message) => {
           const msg = message.toString();
           console.log(`Received message: ${msg} on topic: ${topic}`);
           if (topic === topic1) {
               updateGauge(gauge1, msg, true);
           } else if (topic === topic2) {
               updateGauge(gauge2, msg, false);
           }
       });
   }
   ```

5. **Validate Message Format**:
   Ensure that the messages published to `pc/temperature` and `pi5/temperature` are in the expected format. For `pc/temperature`, the message should match the regex `/CPU Temperature:\s*([\d.]+)°F/`. For `pi5/temperature`, it should be a plain numeric value.

6. **Debug [`updateGauge`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FD%3A%2FAI_assitant%2FmqttStuff%2Fbutton.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A93%2C%22character%22%3A24%7D%7D%5D%2C%224c573a34-cadd-4a9c-a8e6-37412bb21c1c%22%5D "Go to definition") Function**:
   Add additional logging to the [`updateGauge`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FD%3A%2FAI_assitant%2FmqttStuff%2Fbutton.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A93%2C%22character%22%3A24%7D%7D%5D%2C%224c573a34-cadd-4a9c-a8e6-37412bb21c1c%22%5D "Go to definition") function to verify that it is being called with the correct values:

   ```javascript
   function updateGauge(gauge, msg, isFormatted) {
       console.log('Raw temperature value:', msg);
       let temperature;
       if (isFormatted) {
           const match = msg.match(/CPU Temperature:\s*([\d.]+)°F/);
           if (match) {
               temperature = parseFloat(match[1]);
           }
       } else {
           temperature = parseFloat(msg);
       }

       if (!isNaN(temperature)) {
           console.log('Parsed temperature value:', temperature);
           gauge.refresh(temperature);
       } else {
           console.error('Invalid temperature value:', msg);
       }
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the issue preventing the gauges from updating and take appropriate action to resolve it.
