   - Add a `console.log(isFormatted)` to confirm its value.

4. **Validate the Regex Match**:
   - Ensure the regex `/CPU Temperature:\s*([\d.]+)°F/` correctly matches the formatted temperature string.
   - Test the regex separately if needed.

5. **Check [`parseFloat`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FD%3A%2FAI_assitant%2FmqttStuff%2Fbutton.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A162%2C%22character%22%3A38%7D%7D%5D%2C%22c15e9090-978c-4246-935b-413b3aa85f73%22%5D "Go to definition") Conversion**:
   - Ensure [`parseFloat`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FD%3A%2FAI_assitant%2FmqttStuff%2Fbutton.html%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A162%2C%22character%22%3A38%7D%7D%5D%2C%22c15e9090-978c-4246-935b-413b3aa85f73%22%5D "Go to definition") correctly converts the temperature string to a number.
   - Add a `console.log(temperature)` after parsing to verify the value.

6. **Verify `gauge.refresh` Function**:
   - Ensure the `gauge.refresh` function is defined and works as expected.
   - Add a `console.log('Refreshing gauge with:', temperature)` before calling `gauge.refresh`.

7. **Check for JavaScript Errors**:
   - Open the browser console to check for any JavaScript errors that might prevent execution.

8. **Ensure the Function is Called**:
   - Verify that the function containing this code is being called when the server sends the data.

Here is the updated code with additional logging for validation:

```html
console.log('Raw temperature value:', msg);
console.log('isFormatted:', isFormatted);
let temperature;
if (isFormatted) {
    const match = msg.match(/CPU Temperature:\s*([\d.]+)°F/);
    if (match) {
        temperature = parseFloat(match[1]);
        console.log('Matched temperature value:', temperature);
    } else {
        console.error('No match found for formatted temperature:', msg);
    }
} else {
    temperature = parseFloat(msg);
    console.log('Parsed temperature value:', temperature);
}

if (!isNaN(temperature)) {
    console.log('Refreshing gauge with:', temperature);
    gauge.refresh(temperature);
} else {
    console.error('Invalid temperature value:', msg);
}

// Fetch current temperature from weather API
function fetchCurrentTemperature() {
```

Follow these steps and use the additional logging to identify where the issue might be.
